                                For my capstone class project, I designed an online learning platform that aims to improve student engagement and reduce isolation in online courses.
                                The platform features a pedagogical approach that includes peer collaboration and interactions.
                                As part of the this project, I conduced research that included a survey and a design exercise. I also designed an interactive prototype of the system, which I tested with users.

                            <p>
                                Nowadays, with the advancement of technologies, much of our time is spent online. Naturally, much of our learning happens online too.
                                Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have been on a steady rise. Though MOOCs promise to make great education more affordable and universally accessible, they also have serious flaws.
                                Students in MOOCs are isolated and suffer from lack of social interactions with their peers and with the course instructors.
                                I researched these problems and designed Learndevú - a platform that enables student collaboration in online courses. Founded in learning theory, Learndevú aims to reduce the student isolation online.

                                In order to better understand the problem, I created a stakeholder map. The map made me consider all sides of education in general
                                and helped me think of the various possible issues I could explore within online education.

                                I wrote love and breakup letters to my product. The technique is intended to be used as if a user wrote those letters to the product.
                                The love letter helped me explore what features might make my project special and make my users love it.
                                On the other hand, the breakup letter aims at describing why a user might choose to leave the product for a competitor.
                                These design techniques were useful as initial tools to explore my idea and start thinking about its features and possible challenges.

                                In order to explore the problem space, I conducted background research, which included literature review in the following domains:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and eLearning</li>
                                    <li>Online peer collaboration and learning</li>
                                    <li>Learning through video</li>
                                    <li>Individual-Group interactions in online communities</li>
                                    <li>Computer supported collaborative learning</li>

                                </ul>
                            A common recurring theme in my research was that of lack of peer interactions in online courses.
                            I became fascinated with the concept of building a collaborative environment online that enables students to learn from each other.

                                The analysis indicated that though there are many online learning platforms, none of them are focused on rich collaboration between students and instructors. This furthered my interest in the area and convinced me to explore it further.

                                To try to better understand the user needs and explore the solution space, I conducted a design exercise called speed dating, which I ran over
                                10 one-on-one sessions.
                                Users were presented with the 8 storyboards in rapid succession, which I explained. Next, participants were asked to rank the storyboards from most likely to least likely to enhance MOOCs through social engagement and collaboration.
                                Finally, a debriefing sessions was conducted to look into the motivations behind their rankings.
