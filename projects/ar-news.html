                              During my final semester of graduate school, I did an independent study at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mi2lab.com"></a>Michigan Information Interaction Lab. For this project, I wanted to explore the field of augmented reality and what design implications the technology could bring to the world in the future. I decided to design a news application for a head-worn AR device, due to the clear need for such apps in the future, as well as the rich set of design challenges that news come with. I ended up trying out many different prototyping techniques and designing new methods to try and quickly iterate with AR prototypes. I scoped the project to explore how voice and augmented reality technologies can be used to enable people to get their news on the go.

                               People need to consume news for a variety of reasons, including staying informed, learning new things, and even entertainment. As our world is very busy, it is imperative that people still find time to get their news. I explored the state of the art technologies that could enable a modern way to consume news, while on the go. Variations of environments, sound and user preferences had to be accounted for and were critical for a compelling design.

Though a "prototype" of this fidelity had many limitations, it helped me start to understand the design challenges I would need to solve and the use cases I need to think about.

                              Since my research pushed me in the direction of Voice UX as a core part of the app, I developed a Voice prototype using the web service <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sayspring.com/">SaySpring</a>.

                                Though SaySpring was great at creating a high-fidelity voice service, my design also featured augmented reality, in addition to voice. That led me to create a Sketch template that can help me represent voice and AR in the same prototype. My sketch AR + Voice prototyping templated is shown below, along with two sample screens.

                              To give my prototypes a better feel of augmented reality, I used a 360 image of a room as a background. Though still opaque, the image created a more realistic feel of the user interface used in action.

                               Throughout this project, i used research to learn about the challenges in delivering news, and explored the strengths and weaknesses of state of the art technologies in attempting to improve the experience of consuming news. Here are some of my learnings:
                               <ul>
                                    <li>User input is very challenging with a (first generation) Microsoft Hololens. Voice tunred out to be a much more appealing option for a number of user interactions.</li>
                                    <li>Both voice and augmented reality interfaces are very affected by the environment. Loud, outdoor places could be a challenge for both approaches.</li>
                                    <li>News comes in a great variety of shapes and forms. Quickly getting a headline requires a very different interface than an immersive lengthy piece of content.</li>
                                    <li>User research is challenging for emerging technologies, as people are not good at telling you what they want from technologies they have never used before.</li>
                                    <li>Learning how to use Unity to create Hololens apps has a steep learning curve. Unfortunately this left me with no time to do usability testing and add refinements to my prototype. </li>
