                                   I was hired by OptimalWork to help take their web application to the next level. During the process, I conducted research, created wireframes, validated concepts, and delivered a final polished design. hroughout my work, I was able to learn about their target audience and empathize with their needs. I was able to redesign the existing product, with the focus of achieving streamlined interaction flows, stronger brand identity, and better focus on the community aspects of the platform.

                                  My starting point was the existing live product. The goal of the platform is to help people work in a way that is more mindful and fulfilling. OptimalWork aims to apply psychological theories in a way that better connects working with higher meaning and goals. On first impression, the existing product appeared raw and somewhat clunky, and was not communicating its purpose clearly.

                               In order to get myself familiarized with the existing system, and to identify some potential problematic areas, I conducted a UX Audit. During that activity, I went through all the main screens of the product, and analyzed how well they fared in areas, such as interaction design, accessibility, clarity, branding, and information architecture, among others.

                               What I learned was that even though the product looked unpolished and needed updates, it actually featured a lot of userful functionality and a strong underlying potential. The platform featured a combination of learning, various practice tools, as well as self assessment functionality that all work together to help one work in a more mindful way and be more productive.

                                The UX Audit helped me generate ideas about areas of concern, as well as ones with potential. I also talked with the team and understood where their areas of current focus are. The two data sources helped me create a research plan, that I then used during my initial research interviews. I interviewed 5 participants in a semi-structured exploratory study that aimed at understanding the following:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>What made them use the product.</li>
                                    <li>What goals they had with using the product, and how well thoese were being met.</li>
                                    <li>What their current needs and pain points were.</li>
                                    <li>What aspects of the product they liked and used often.</li>
                                </ul>

                                The interview helped me learn about the users of the product and empathize with them better. I would later use this data to identify problem areas and brainstorm potential solutions.
