                                   Azure Data Studio (ADS) is a new tool for data professionals from Microsoft. One of the key features of the product are the computation notebooks (or just notebooks). I was tasked with improving the usability and functionality of these notebooks, in order to increase the overall adoption and value proposition of ADS. During the last year, I identified and designed a number of improvements to our notebooks, and many of them were shipped and proved to be successful.

                                   Even though notebooks were considered a core part of Azure Data Studio, the team had received feedback that there were usability issues that needed to be resolved. In addition, the adoption rate of Azure Data Studio was not ideal and needed an accelerator. Due to these reasons, I was tasked with redesigning the notebook experience and thus increasing the value of ADS.

Notebooks are split into cells, which are used to separate various blocks of code and text. The mixing of code and text can be a powerful tool for a number of use cases, including for handing off code to other people, while also including useful descriptions bundled with the code itself, instead of having to create separate documentation files elsewhere.

                               In order to get familiar with the domain and the state of the art, I conducted an analysis of other computational notebooks. I noticed that there were a lot of different opinions around the user experience of a notebook, and that there were also a lot of potential areas for improvements. My analysis indicated that the field is still relatively new that there are a lot of opportunities for creating value.

Further analysis of the features indicated various potential usability issues that I noted. Though I saw these areas for improvement, I also noticed that the notebooks also had some strengths that I could build upon.

                                We made several improvements to the usability of our text cells. For example, we introdcued a rich text editor, which enabled customers to no longer need to use markdown for formatting. We paired the new editor with a toolbar, which allowed for even greater ease of use. 

                                We also introducted a new cell toolbar, which helped with accessibility and discoverability of features.

                                We refreshed the notebook toolbar with our design language. This helped make our noteboos visually consistent with the rest of our product. It also introducted a new action order, which made it easier to find the key actions available on a notebook.

                                In order to help users manage their notebooks easier, we introduced a new Notebooks section to the product. Up to this point, users had to find their notebooks, while going through all the ofther files they had added to ADS. Our new section hid all the unnecessary details and allowed users to focus on their notebooks. In addition, we were also able to introduce notebook-specific search functionality, which allows users to find notebooks or text withing notebooks by keyword.

                               The redesigned notebook was well received by the team. We were able to ship much of it, and we are continuing to invest in this area. The overall product adoption accelerated significantly during the last year and a half, resulting in a 400% increase in monthly active users.
