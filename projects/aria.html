                            As part of the CHI Student Design Competition 2017, we created ARIA - a device and video player combination that
                            aims to help self-learning guitarists learn faster from online tutorial on YouTube. The control device is placed on a guitar and allows the student to control the video player and thus decrease the learning time and make the lesson much more pleasant.

                        <p>
                            With the spread of online communities, self-learning has become ubiquitous. Though much work has been done to help beginner learners, we identified
                            Mid-level guitarist learners as a group that finds scarce learning resources and tools. The online materials are inconsistent and not personalizable. In addition, the time required to laern on their own, as opposed to having formal education can be significantly longer and could lead to students losing motivation or giving up.

                            We wanted to get a good understanding of the relevant factors that might affect Iorios' performance.

                            <li>1 was just starting out - he helped us understand what he was looking for while learning.</li>

                            We asked the users to try to learn a new song using YouTube. We gave them sticky notes and told them they could imagine a device or an interface that can control the video and do what they need from the lesson. We also asked them to place the sticky note at the place they deemed best fit.
