                            Autodesk Screencast is a tool that allows users to record, edit and watch interactive instructional videos. During a summer internship, I worked with two ohter interns to redesign Screencast and make it more accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Our design also made Screencast easier to moderate, improved its SEO and made it a better fit for educational institutions.

                            Screencast is a great learning resource for Autodesk customers. It allows experts to record their screens and share their knowledge with others. However, Screencast is not accessible by customers who are deaf or hard of hearing.
                            This prevents the tool from reaching such customers and makes it not appropriate for use in educational institutions. The tool needs to be redesigned to be more accessible and more appropriate for educational institutions.

                            In order to get familiar with the existing Screencast product, we started by conducting heuristic evaluation and looked through existing research that the team had already documented. We also went through the usage data that we could get through Google Analytics and the Autodesk Community Forums. This gave us valuable insights that hinted at potential usability challenges and aided our research going forward.

                        <p class="col-xs-12">
                            We created a stakeholder map to get insights into the following questions:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Who are all the stakeholders of the project?</li>
                                <li>What were the project goals?</li>
                                <li>Who is the target audience?</li>
                                <li>How does the team feel the project met the initial goals?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We needed to do this, because we needed to understand why Screencast was designed the way it was, what insights played a major decision role and what technical limitations were in play. During this activity, we mapped out all of the project stakeholders, while also including their job title and how they related to each other in the project. Then, we conducted 1:1 interviews with all the stakeholders on our list and got their perspective on the product and how it was built.

                            Next, we conducted a competitive analysis in three dimensions - recorders, transcription services, and players with transcripts. This gave us a better understanding of some of the problems we might face, as well as how other solutions have tackled them. Accessibility and ease of use were among our top traits to look for during our analysis. During this activity, we were able to see a diverse set of takes on how a screencasting software should look and behave. We saw that many of the features were repeated across the various products, but also that the interaction design decisions were quite varied.

                            To better understand our target population and user needs, we conducted interviews with Screencast users. The users varied in levels of experience with the app. We interviewed people from various geographic locations and needs. In addition, we spoke to some people that were deaf or hard of hearing, while also interviewing users that were not. This diverse set of interviewees helped us understand the different needs of our user base and helped guide our design.

                            We then created high-level prototypes using Framer. We picked that tool, because of its ability to produce highly interactive prototypes. We believed this was required for effectively testing a video player concept, as we wanted to truly test how someone learns from and interacts with a video. Below is a video of what our prototype looked like.

                            We redesigned Screencast, to make it better and more useful to our customers. Here are the improvements over the old design:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> - The new design is accessible to customers who are deaf or hard of hearing, because it includes a transcript and closed captions</li>
                                <li><strong>Education</strong> - Since educational institutions are required to make their video materials accessible to students who are deaf or hard of hearing, the new design is much more appropriate for educational use</li>
                                <li><strong>Google SEO</strong> - Because the transcript is indexable by Google's bots, the videos would be much easier to find in Google searches </li>
                                <li><strong>Search within Autodesk Knowledge Network</strong> - The transcript can also be fed into our search engine for better search results</li>
                                <li><strong>Moderation</strong> - The transcript allows for automatically flagging profanities in the audio of videos, which makes moderation of the screencasts much easier</li>
                            </ul>
                            The next phase of the project is for the product team to scope the project, plan it, and for the developers to make the changes to the application.
