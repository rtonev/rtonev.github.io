                        <p>
                            Autodesk Screencast is a tool that allows users to record, edit and watch interactive instructional videos. During my summer internship, I worked on redesigning Screencast to make it more accessible to customers who are deaf and hard of hearing.
                            In addition, My team and I also redesigned the user interface to make it more streamlines and improve the overall customer experience.

                        <p>Screencast is a great learning resource for Autodesk customers. It allows experts to record their screens and share their knowledge with others. However, Screencast is not accessible by customers who are deaf or hard of hearing.
                            This prevents the tool from reaching such customers and makes it not appropriate for use in educational institutions. </p>

                        <p>In order to get familiar with the product, we started by conducting heuristic evaluation and looked through existing research that the team had already documented.
                            We also went through the data that we can get through Google Analytics and the Autodesk Community Forums

                            To better understand our target population and user needs, we conducted interviews with Screencast users. The users varied in levels of experience with the app. We also interviewed some users were hard of hearing, as well as other that were not.

                            We then created high-level prototypes using Framer. We picked that tool, because of its ability to produce highly interactive prototypes. We believed this was required for effectively testing a video player concept.

                            We tested our prototypes with 6 customers, 2 of which were deaf or hard of hearing. Our testing gave us insights into what worked and what could be improved with our design. This led us to continue refining our prototype.
                            The test sessions included the following steps:

                        <p>
                            We redesigned Screencast, to make it better and more useful to our customers. Here are the improvements over the old design:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> - The new design is accessible to customers who are deaf or hard of hearing, because it includes a transcript and closed captions</li>
                                <li><strong>Education</strong> - Since educational institutions are required to make their vido materials accessible to students who are deaf or hard of hearing, the new design is much more appropriate for educational use</li>
                                <li><strong>Google SEO</strong> - Because the transcript is indexable by Google's bots, the videos would be much easier to find in Google searches </li>
                                <li><strong>Search within Autodesk Knowledge Network</strong> - The transcript can also be fed into our search engine for better search results</li>
                                <li><strong>Moderation</strong> - The transcript allows for automatically flagging profanities in the audio of videos, which makes moderation of the screencasts much easier</li>
                            </ul>
                            The next phase of the project is for the product team to scope the project, plan it, and for the developers to make the changes to the application.
