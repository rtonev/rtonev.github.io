                                During my work at IBM, I was tasked with working on an open-source tool called KUI. The product is a command line interface (CLI) that also has graphic user interface (GUI) features. I redesigned the tool's user experience, in order to make it more valuable to people. I also designed a way in which KUI would be integrated into IBM's flagship cloud management tool, IBM Multicloud Manager.

                                KUI is an open-source tool developed in IBM Research that meant to modernize the Terminal/CLI experience by adding GUI-like features, like charts, tables and and richer interactions. Though the tool had a lot of potential, it was lacking cohesive design and its supported features were not built in a human-centered way. I was tasked with improving the functionality and usability of the product, while keeping its core DNA of being a CLI that includes elements of modern graphic interfaces.

                                <a href="https://kubernetes.io" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> is a system for managing scalable cloud-native systems. It relies on a set of commands for a terminal CLI. In order to make Kubernetes easier to learn and use, companies have been developing applications that feature full-fledged GUIs, which removes the need for people to learn and use commands. IBM's flagship application of this kind is called IBM Multi-Cloud Manager (MCM).

                                KUI was developed in IBM Research with the idea of making Kubernetes commands more powerful and easier to use by introducing modern graphic interface elements into a traditional CLI. This approach had the promise of keeping the strengths of a traidtional CLI, while also mitigating its weakness of not having rich interactions and visuals.

                               As I moved to higher fidelity in Sketch, I prototyped the key use cases, applied the IBM Carbon design language, and envisioned what integrating KUI inside of IBM Multicloud Manager (MCM) would look like. I built on top of the promise of KUI, but I ended up redesigning much of the interactions and visuals that it offered, in order to make it more consistent and easier to use.

                                After collecting the insights from the study, I made some updates and collaborated with a visual designer to create a high-fidelity prototype. We tweaked the spacing, added colors and made sure that we are aligned to our guidelines around UI components and illustrations.

                                    Our final design was delivered and presented to the team. It was well received and successfully implemented into MCM. As next steps, the team will observe how users are utilizing KUI and will strive to learn and improve the design. I believe that KUI can be further expanded to cover more use cases and provide more value to customers.
