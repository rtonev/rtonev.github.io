                                <p>UMHealthResearch.org is a web portal that allows people to sign-up for clinical trials.
                                    It connects the community of volunteers to the researchers at the University of
                                    Michigan.
                                    I worked on the design and development of the portal. I was involved with most aspects of the product,
                                    including feature design, front-end & back-end development, as well as infrastructure setup.

                                <p>The portal allows researchers to publish their studies in a searchable format that allows potential volunteers to easily discover them.</p>

                                <p>We followed agile development methodologies and split our process into bi-weekly sprints during which we went through full development cycles
                                for each feature that we developed. We started each spring with requirements gathering and design. These steps were followed by development of the features.
                                    We then showed our progress to our client and got feedback. Finally, we did an iteration retrospective to discuss what aspect of the spring went well and which ones needed improvement.</p>

                                <p>The product currently has over 26,000 active users who have shown interest in studies over 100,000 times. Additionally, the portal has over 300 actively recruiting studies.
                                    We strive to make recruitment for studies much easier and more effective. We hope that through UMHealthResearch.org we could do our part to push research forward.
